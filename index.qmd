Hi! My name is Maggie Church. I am a Ph.D. student in the [Landscape Modeling lab](https://www.landscapemodeling.net/), led by Dr. Jessica O'Connell. My work focuses on applying remote sensing to better understand ecological systems at broad scales. Outside of my research, I enjoy backpacking, trail running, and trying new ice cream shops.
