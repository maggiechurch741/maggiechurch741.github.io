Hi! My name is Maggie Church. I am a Ph.D. student in the [Landscape Modeling lab](https://www.landscapemodeling.net/), led by Dr. Jessica O'Connell. My work focuses on applying remote sensing to better understand surface water dynamics at broad scales. Previously, I spent 4 years as a data analyst and 12 months hiking the U.S. Outside of my research, I enjoy backpacking, trail running, and trying out new ice cream shops.
